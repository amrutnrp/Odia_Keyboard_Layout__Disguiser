# Odia_Keyboard_Layout
New Layout and method of typing Odia characters (implemented in python)

This is v5.0. the goal is to make it more friendly towards user. 
I dumped all config to text so that, pyexcel-ods lib wont be required

Install python, pyperclip

You can type Odia Characters in regular Keyboard in very fast manner. 
Easy to switch from English to Odia Kayboard.
You run the program, GUI will appear-> Type whatever you want -> "Copy" the content and paste it somewhere.
It's not a high-end integrated solution like Akruti and stuff; but it's a good solution for whoever trying to write essays or for "trasliteration"/transcription/modernisaiton of odia texts.

If you're interested to make similar Kayboard for other indic languages, please contact me for any help/ understanding of the code. Let's collaborate together.






Planning to make a Hardware Dongle to convert regular USB keyboard to Odia compatible Keyboard - via raspberry pi zero- (just for proof of concept )
Seriously thinking of making a desktopp software.
Let's see how that turns out.
