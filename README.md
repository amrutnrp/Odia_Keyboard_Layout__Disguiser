thinking of chaning some stuff, excel row/col feels like a limitatiton. We can just ignore if the map is not present.
Also, efficiency is too bad. Seriously thinking of making a desktopp software
Planning to make Hardware dongle- by raspberry pi zero.. let's see how that turns out.

# Odia_Keyboard_Layout
New Layout and method of typing Odia characters (implemented in python)

This is v4.0, implementated using h-emphasis to spell ka-> kha, and f-emphasis to mix consonants. Staggered Key typing and emphasis buttons in center alllows to type faster- as pressing same key twice or pressing shift frequently, slows down the typing efficiency.

Install the following python libraries before starting the program
Python 3 only (No Python2 support); Tkinter (default); pyperclip

You can type Odia Characters in regular Keyboard in very fast manner. 
Easy to switch from English to Odia Kayboard.
You run the program, GUI will appear-> Type whatever you want -> "Copy" the content and paste it somewhere.
It's not a high-end integrated solution like Akruti and stuff; but it's a good solution for whoever trying to write essays or for "trasliteration"/transcription/modernisaiton of odia texts.

If you're interested to make similar Kayboard for other indic languages, please contact me for any help/ understanding of the code. Let's collaborate together.






In Future, Planning to make a Hardware Dongle to convert regular USB keyboard to Odia compatible Keyboard.
The Odia Keyboard will have it's new features and custom ways of typing without any 3rd party software installation.
But that looks  difficult as of now- because of the implementation.
