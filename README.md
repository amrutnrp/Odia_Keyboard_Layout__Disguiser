# Odia_Keyboard_Layout_amrut
New Layout and method of typing Odia characters 
#implemented in Python

You can type Odia Characters in regular Keyboard in very fast manner. 
Easy to switch from English to Odia Kayboard.
You run the program, GUI will appear-> Type whatever you want -> "Copy" the content and paste it somewhere.
It's not a high-end integrated solution like Akruti and stuff; but it's a good solution ...
     ... for whoever trying to write essays or for "trasliteration".

If you're interested to make similar Kayboard for other indic languages, please contact me for any help/ understanding of the code. Let's collaborate together.



In Future, Planning to make a Hardware Dongle to convert regular USB keyboard to Odia compatible Keyboard.
The Odia Keyboard will have it's new features and custom ways of typing without any 3rd party software installation.
But that looks  difficult as of now- because of the implementation.
